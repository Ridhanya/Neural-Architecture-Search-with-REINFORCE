# Neural-Architecture-Search-with-REINFORCE

The main goal is to implement a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework with conv1D and dense layers as search space, Reinforce policy gradients as Search Strategy and low fidelity estimate (train for a few epochs) as the Performance Estimation strategy. The complete code and explanations with the concepts are in the Google Colab notebook. You just need to change the data and relevant locations for all of these to work. You can also copy these functions to different code files and make a pipeline if Google colab or any notebook is where you don't want to perform NAS. Please raise any issues, if any. It would help improve the codes.
